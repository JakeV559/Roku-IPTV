This is fork of -> The Simplest Application for Roku you can use to watch IPTV.

-------------------
NOTE:  Be warned. Be tolerant. Looks like a hack job and it is. I am a newbie just learning scenegraph/brightscript with little coding etiquette. 
-------------------

7.30.17 Initial fork of the original.  This will be an ongoing newbie hack/slash/copy-paste. Be careful forking this version.
7.30.17 Updated to current coding including all the bugs, issues, errors and more!  Just something to get started sharing.
7.31.17 Better m3u8 parser code added. Added a set back to demo url button to keyboard
<br>
8.1.17  Stable and somewhat working as is.  Forking this over to a development repo to continue with additional features.

This is the CURRENT stable version from our group project (https://www.facebook.com/groups/rokumania) that is published as a private | non-certified roku channel (http://my.roku.com/add/m3uplayer) for group members to play custom .m3u playlists FREE w/no-ads.

I will branch this working/somewhat stable version over to a development branch to make some major changes to move forward with multiple playlist slots, etc.

Have fun! Join the RokuMania group! for future projects.
