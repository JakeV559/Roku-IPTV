# Roku-IPTV
This is fork of -> The Simplest Application for Roku you can use to watch IPTV

-------------------
NOTE:  Be warned. Be tolerant. Looks like a hack job and it is. I am a newbie just learning scenegraph/brightscript with little coding etiquette. 
-------------------

7.30.17 Initial fork of the original.  This will be an ongoing newbie hack/slash/copy-paste. Currently not the version you see as a non-certified|private channel. 

7.30.17 Updated to current coding including all the bugs, issues, errors and more!  Just something to get started sharing.
7.31.17 Better m3u8 parser code added.
